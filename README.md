# RFG Texture Editor Redux
An updated version of the texture editor for Red Faction Guerrilla originally made by 0luke0. The original version no longer works and so this version was created. It was made by dumping/decompiling source code from the application with [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy), and modifying that.
